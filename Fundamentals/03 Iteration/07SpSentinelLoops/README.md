There is a special sentinel loop that can be used with cin. There is a special character that terminates all text files: CTRL-Z. Whenever C++ encounters this character when reading a file, it terminates all input from that file. The cin stream is considered a text file. So it is possible to use the CTRL-Z character to indicate to a program that no more input is available.

What makes this type of loop so appealing is that the initialization, test, and update are all in the same place. The statement cin >> first returns a value of  true if a valid input is entered. It will return false if an invalid input, like CTRL-Z, is entered.
