These are loops that everyone seems to love. People love them so much that they try to use them inappropriately. The only time to use a count loop is when the program can determine ahead of time how many times the loop will repeat. This is not always possible.

- The loop always repeats the same number of times.
- The program calculates the number of repetitions based upon user input.
