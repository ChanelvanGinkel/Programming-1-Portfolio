Conditional loops have common traits with sentinel and count loops. They are like sentinel loops in that it is unknow before time how may times they will repeat. They are like count loops in that they terminate as the result of a calculation, instead of based upon user input. A count loop uses a simple calculation to determine when the loop should end. Count loops can use very complicated calculations.
